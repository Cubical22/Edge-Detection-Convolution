easter egg :)

if you use the following pattern: <br>
[ <br>
>    [0.5, 0.5, 0.5],<br>
>    [0.5, -5, 0.5],<br>
>    [0.5, 0.5, 0.5],<br>

]

and make sure that instead of red, you place black,
it would give you the outline of the image.

if you use the following one: <br>
[ <br>
>    [1, 1, 1],<br>
>    [0, 0, 0],<br>
>    [-1, -1, -1],<br>

]

this would give you a vertical edge detection instead of a horizontal one.
